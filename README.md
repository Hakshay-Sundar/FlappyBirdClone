There are a lot of things that could be improved upon this such as:
  * Animation for the bird based on gravity.
  * More interactive alerts and dialogs.
  * Scoring the game as and when the bird passes the obstacle instead of when that specific obstacle is destroyed.
  * Better handling of touch events so as to prevent multiple leaps consecutively by the bird.
  * More intuitive distancing of the pipes and differences in heights instead of random values.
